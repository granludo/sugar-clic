The main objective of this project is to adapt JClic to the Sugar/OLPC platform, thus mitigating the lack
of educational content that is currently for OLPC, making this platform available JClic activities that 
exist on the Internet.

More specifically, this project to JClic focuses on developing a Clic Activity Player, to deliver contents 
already created by educators worldwide. This project is leaded by Maria Jose Casany and Ludo (Marc Alier) 
from the GESSI research group of the UPC, and benefits from contributions of several students of the 
Computer Science School FIB at UPC Barcelona.
